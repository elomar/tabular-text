= TabularText

TabularText helps you create files composed of lines with fields in fixed positions. Yes, people still use that. Yes, a more structured format would be best.

Example, writing

  builder.line do |l| 
    l.field 'Name has 30 chars', 30
    l.field 1, 6
    l.field 27
  end

will generate

  Name has 30 chars             00000127

A more detailed README will be written the day anyone thinks about using this.
